			<h2>What Is JavaScript? A Basic Introduction to JS for Beginners</h2>
			<p>
				The development of JavaScript frameworks, consisting of JavaScript code libraries, allows developers to use
				pre-written JavaScript code in their projects. It saves them time and effort from having to code programming
				features from scratch. Each JavaScript framework has features that aim to simplify the development and debugging
				process. For example, front-end JavaScript frameworks like jQuery and ReactJS improve design efficiency. They
				allow developers to reuse and update code components without affecting each other, function or value-wise.
				Meanwhile, mobile application development frameworks such as Cordova and Titanium make it possible to create
				native or hybrid applications. The implementation of JavaScript code in Node.js also plays an important role in
				web development. Node.js can reduce server response time due to its single-threaded nature and non-blocking
				architecture and omit delays. Node.js is also lightweight enough to serve as a scalable tool for microservices,
				allowing you to develop a single app comprising small services with individual processes.
